# Binary Calculator

This is a simple multiplication problem. Since the second number is always a power of 2, you do not need to convert the numbers to their decimal form. Multiplying a binary number by $2^x$ is equivalent to bitshifting it to the left by $x$. (i.e adding $x$ zeros to the end)

Therefore, simply print the original number with an additional $x$ zeros at the end.
